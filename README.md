# SimpleDataStructures.jl

This package implements data structures, **simply**.

Code that is essential for the data structures to work is included; everything else is left out.

All data structures are implemented in Julia. These implementations show off the flexibility and extensibility of Julia's type system: the new types *just work*. Examples of the APIs are provided.

Data structures implemented:
- `SimpleVector`
- `SimpleSparseVector`
- `SimpleDict`
- `SimpleDefaultDict`
- `SimpleLinkedList`
- `SimpleStack`
- `SimpleQueue`


This package is largely for demonstration purposes only and not for production use.
